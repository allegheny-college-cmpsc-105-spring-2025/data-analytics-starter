TODO: To embed your own form, replace the link with your own form's `embed link`.
To get the `embed link`, on the google form creation page, click on the three
vertical dots on the far right. There you will see an option for the embed code.
Copy the code and swap it in for the equivalent code above. 

TODO: At this point, check to see who has their surveys up, and go ahead and give
them your data! [All urls from classmates' websites](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bVYuF_9NcIi0qet6Rn7sf6_3gjHtXL4ks6hcPrb1uYU/edit?usp=sharing) can be found at the link.

TODO: Please do at least every survey!

TODO: Check off those that you have done.

TODO: You can now check to see your data. If you have responses from 15+ people,
download the CSV files using the names `data_survey.csv` and `data_analytics.csv`.

TODO: If you reupload those files into your GitHub Repos under the data directory,
the `Data` tab should show your data!!

TODO: Now find the ipynb file in your GitHub repo and continue with the TODOs.
